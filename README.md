# Netflix_Movies_TV_shows_Clustering_Unsupervised_Learning

Project Summary -

The objective of this project is to analyze and cluster a dataset related to Netflix. The dataset consists of various attributes associated with Netflix shows and movies, such as title, genre, release year, duration, rating, and others. The aim is to explore patterns and similarities among the content available on the platform and group them into meaningful clusters.

To begin with, the dataset will be preprocessed by handling missing values, removing irrelevant columns, and transforming categorical variables into numerical representations. Feature engineering techniques may also be applied to extract useful information from the existing attributes.

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be utilized to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries will be used to understand the distribution of variables, identify any trends, and explore relationships between different features.

Once the dataset has been thoroughly analyzed, clustering algorithms such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, or density-based spatial clustering will be employed. These algorithms will group similar Netflix shows and movies together based on their attributes. The optimal number of clusters will be determined using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette analysis.

After the clustering process, the results will be evaluated and interpreted. The clusters will be analyzed to understand the common characteristics and patterns within each group. This analysis will provide valuable information for Netflix in terms of content categorization, recommendation systems, and content acquisition strategies.

Finally, the findings and insights from the clustering analysis will be summarized and presented in a clear and concise manner. Visualizations, charts, and graphs will be used to effectively communicate the outcomes of the project. Recommendations may also be provided based on the identified clusters, suggesting potential improvements or strategies for Netflix to enhance user experience and content offerings.

In conclusion, this project aims to analyze a Netflix dataset, perform clustering techniques to group similar shows and movies together, and provide insights and recommendations based on the clustering results. The project will contribute to a better understanding of Netflix's content landscape and aid in decision-making processes for the company.

Problem Statement This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

Attribute Information

show_id : Unique ID for every Movie / Tv Show

type : Identifier - A Movie or TV Show

title : Title of the Movie / Tv Show

director : Director of the Movie

TF-IDF combines two metrics: Term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).

Term Frequency (TF): This metric measures the frequency of a term in a document. It assumes that the more often a term appears in a document, the more relevant it is to that document. It is calculated using the formula:

TF(t, d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)

Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): This metric measures the importance of a term across a collection of documents. It gives higher weight to terms that appear less frequently in the entire collection. It is calculated using the formula:

IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)

The plot will also indicate the "elbow" point, which represents the recommended number of clusters based on the selected metric.Using elbow plot with the optimal number of 5 clusters .



CONCLUSION

1.It's noteworthy that most of the content offered on Netflix is in the form of movies. However, the platform has been emphasising TV shows more recently.

2- The majority of these shows debut at the end or beginning of the year.

3-Among the top five nations that create all of the content that is made available on the platform are the United States and India. Furthermore, six of the top ten actors with the most content hail from India.

4- TV-MA dominates the charts for content ratings, showing that mature content is more well-liked on Netflix.

5- The data were clustered using the value of k=15, which was found to be the best option. Ten different clusters were created using this value.

6- Using this information, a content-based recommender system was developed using cosine similarity, which offered suggestions for films and television programmes.
